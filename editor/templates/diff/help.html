<h3>Diff</h3>
<p>
By default the current contents of tab 1 and tab 2 will be compared with each other. If you input 
a tab number, the current tab will be compared with the entered tab number. If the entered tab number
is also the tab you are currently on, your current changes will be compared to the saved changes. 
If you do not use tabs, this will also be the default behaviour.
